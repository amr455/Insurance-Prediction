# **Insurance Value Prediction Using Linear Regression**

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project involves developing a **linear regression model** to predict **insurance value** based on **seven key features**. The model initially achieved **79% accuracy**, which improved to **100% after outlier removal**.

## 🔑 **Project Steps**

### 1️⃣ **Data Exporting**

- Imported and loaded the dataset for analysis.

### 2️⃣ **Data Preprocessing**

- Detected and handled missing values.
- Identified and removed outliers to improve model performance.

### 3️⃣ **Feature Engineering**

- Applied **feature scaling** to standardize numerical data.
- Performed **feature transformation** to enhance predictive power.
- Used **label encoding** to handle categorical variables.

### 4️⃣ **Training Step**

- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Selected the best-fitting linear regression model.
- Trained the model using the prepared dataset.

### 5️⃣ **Model Evaluation**

- Made predictions on the test dataset.
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy metrics.
- Achieved **100% accuracy** after outlier removal.
